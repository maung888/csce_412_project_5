        The first service I would like to talk about is <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/min-sithu-maung-230ab1205" target="_blank">my job</a>. 
        Even though, I am a paid employee I count my
         job as a service. In my job I create web pages non-profit organizations that serves the people in need. 
         Most of our clients are organizations that help with rehabilitation of drug users, victims of abuse and 
         domestic violence, and homeless people. I feel proud that I can help these people by taking a small part 
         in this process of creating webpages that collect the data of these victims and we send the data to appropriate 
         agencies. Therefore, I count my job also as a community service.

      <p class="project-description">
        My second service is helping in <a href="https://www.hopechc.org/" target="_blank">Hope Clinic</a>. My uncle is a health advocate at Hope clinic. So, whenever
        there are events organized by Hope Clinic, I volunteer by setting up the tables and distributing medical 
        and wellbeing equipment to various communities in need.
