      <h2>Project 1 (HCSS Dashboard)</h2>
      <p class="project-description">
        <a href="https://devpost.com/software/hcss-dashbord" target="_blank"> HCSS Dashboard</a>  is created as a project for CodeRed Artemis Hackathon organized by the University of Houston. 
         CodeRed Artemis is the biggest hackathon in Houston at that time. Representatives from 
         <a href="https://www.hcss.com/about-us/" target="_blank">Heavy Construction Systems
          Specialist (HCSS) </a>H give us the requirements to complete the project. The data was given to us in JSON format, and
           we have to process that data and display as bar graphs and pie chars. So, our project 
           is a <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/data-visualization#:~:text=Data%20visualization%20is%20the%20representation,that%20is%20easy%20to%20understand." target="_blank"> data visualization </a>
           project. I was mainly involved in the front-end and marketing part of the project.

      <h2>Project 2 (This Website) </h2>
      <p class="project-description">
        I am developing this website for CSCE 315 under Professor Ritchey. This website is intended to boost my professional
         presence on the internet. As a software developer, having a website where you can share your skillset is crucial.
         This website contains 5 pages: About Me, Technical Portfolio, Qualifications, Services and AI Page. I used HTML, 
         CSS, and JavaScript to build this website without using any frameworks. About Me is the landing page if you visit
          this website. It contains a short introduction to me. The navigation bar has links to all the other pages and
           the footer has the links to my social networks such as GitHub, LinkedIn, and email. I implemented the same 
           navigation bar and the footer for the all the pages. The technical portfolio page (this page) contains the 
           projects I have done. I have displayed 2 projects. The Qualifications page includes a button to download my
           resume and a comprehensive description of my technical skills. The service section includes the volunteering
            activities that I have done to contribute my community. The AI page is a page generated by ChatGPT 
            (an AI language model). That page includes a canvas where you can draw anything you want. You can also reset 
            the canvas and download the image after you have drawing it.
